Up early - woken by train works 

Packing and rushing around 

Loading and bikes 
We have a lot of stuff

This is a picture from the packing proess the previous night. 
 
Driving down to Eurotunnel - car heavy and strange to steer 

The vibe in the Eurotunnel was somewhere between 28 Days Later and Boxing Day at the Debenhams sale.  Most things shut or roped 
off, and enormous queues for the other bits - no-one should care that much about Starbucks' terrible coffee, so we content ourselves with an iced coffee from WH Smith, 
and head off back to the car.  At least we're at the front of the queue having missed the earlier train.

If you've read any of these previous blog posts, you'll know that trains are probably my favourite way of travelling, especially in Not the UK, 
because European trains tend to be frequent, punctual, comfortable and not expensive.   And the ability to take the car on the train and have it available 
at the other side is doubly great.  The return trip with the car cost us about Â£280, which is decent value.  The crossing itself was a little 
dull, since we weren't able to get out of the car and check out the buffet car in the Age of Corona, but pleasant enough.

There's no other way to look at it - Calais looks like a sprawling, inverted prison camp, a latter day fortress to keep out whichever bogeymen the British 
public are concerned about this year.  This is of course, by design, but it isn't the French or the other Europeans that have done this, it's British exceptionalism.  The external borders of the EU don't look like this, in the main part - we travelled south from Hungary in 2016 at the height of one of the previous waves of desperate people trying to get into Europe, and the borders 
were still not as heavily fortified as this. For that matter, the Serbia/Kosovo border barely looks like this.  Super depressing.

After taking a wrong turn at one of the roundabouts (and ending up at EuroCity, the large shopping centre, which will come in handy on the way back), and seeing the crowds of mainly young guys, but also a distressing number of kids, we're on the motorway 
and toll roads and heading south.
