Up early - woken by train works 

Packing and rushing around 

Loading and bikes 
We have a lot of stuff

This is a picture from the packing proess the previous night. 
 
Driving down to Eurotunnel - car heavy and strange to steer 

The vibe in the Eurotunnel was somewhere between 28 Days Later and Boxing Day at the Debenhams sale.  Most things shut or roped 
off, and enormous queues for the other bits - no-one should care that much about Starbucks' terrible coffee, so we content ourselves with an iced coffee from WH Smith, 
and head off back to the car.  At least we're at the front of the queue having missed the earlier train.

If you've read any of these previous blog posts, you'll know that trains are probably my favourite way of travelling, especially in Not the UK, 
because European trains tend to be frequent, punctual, comfortable and not expensive.   And the ability to take the car on the train and have it available 
at the other side is doubly great.  The return trip with the car cost us about £280, which is decent value.  The crossing itself was a little 
dull, since we weren't able to get out of the car and check out the buffet car in the Age of Corona, but pleasant enough.

There's no other way to look at it - Calais looks like a sprawling, inverted prison camp, a latter day fortress to keep out whichever bogeymen the British 
public are concerned about this year.  This is of course, by design, but it isn't the French or the other Europeans that have done this, it's British exceptionalism.  The external borders of the EU don't look like this, in the main part - we travelled south from Hungary in 2016 at the height of one of the previous waves of desperate people trying to get into Europe, and the borders 
were still not as heavily fortified as this. For that matter, the Serbia/Kosovo border barely looks like this.  Super depressing.

After taking a wrong turn at one of the roundabouts (and ending up at EuroCity, the large shopping centre, which will come in handy on the way back), and seeing the crowds of mainly young guys, but also a distressing number of kids, we're on the motorway 
and toll roads and heading south.

As we were driving to Champagne,  and we'd been going since the early morning, we opted to take an early lunch in Saint Omer.  Oddly, my main reference point for the town was 
that it was where Douglas Bader, the WWII RAF fighter pilot was shot down and captured by the Germans in 1941.  Sadly, there didn't seem to be any trace or note of that, although it's not likely 
to be the sort of thing that most French citizens care about - thousands of pilots from both sides were shot down over the Hauts-de-France region during the course of the war.

But it's a very pretty small town, only a population of around 15,000.  In spite of that, there were a number of cafes and restaurants, as is typically the case in most european towns and cities.  Being early August
it was a beautiful day, and in line with Coronavirus worries, we opted to eat outside, at [Ril's](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ril's/@50.7490728,2.249566,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47dcf8af05946669:0x7fe6187fbdfca17f!8m2!3d50.7490728!4d2.25176).  
The food here was plentiful and tasty, not the finest cuisine going but inexpensive and well-cooked.  A charcuterie and bacon salad (bacon/ham, delete depending on your descriptive preference here, it was more akin to Spanish Jambon than anything), the world's
richest most decadent Croque Monsieur, which J could only eat about half of, and an omelette.

After a jaunt to stretch our legs around the main square, with this imposing theatre, for such a small town, we swapped drivers and were off again.

At another driving stop, the boy was keen to drive.  We opted to not start him on the motorway, though.

Say what you will about the toll motorway system in France, but the roads were fast, quiet (although it was Sunday) and well maintained, with rest and services every 10-15km.  We made good progress and arrived 
in Champagne around 6pm.  We had a single night Airbnb and met our be-masked host, who let us in to the apartment, which was far better than the (rather nice) photos. 

A quick freshen up (and a _serious_ stretch of the legs for me - sitting for 10 hours meant that my legs were very crampy, something that I wasn't prepared for or expecting) and dinner in the main square. 

Along the way, we saw the beautiful _Église Collégiale Notre-Dame-en-Vaux_ one of the main attractions in the Marne region.

Not to mention these guys on the river.

Unfortunately we didn't get in to the cluster (it being late on a Sunday evening and us leaving early the next day), which is a shame when the interior looks like this (Borrowed from wikimedia)

We dined at the Annexe restaurant in the main square, again, eating outside.  It was pretty unremarkable, in that I can't remember anything about it writing after the fact.

But it did have very inexpensive local champagne!

And some very nice soft drinks. 

The temperature dropped drastically after the sun ducked behind the town hall, and we were left wishing for warmer clothes.  Heading back to the apartment, we moved the car and opted to leave the bikes on the car, and just chain them to each other.  
If someone wants the kiddo's bike (probably the most expensive of the three) then they'll have to take my chonky boi commuter bike and M's _very_ heavy Dutch bike as well.  Plus we could see it from the apartment, and somehow Chalons-en-Champagne doesn't seem like a crime hotspot.

Bon nuit.
