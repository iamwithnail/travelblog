## Coming back

It's nice to be able to come back to Budapest.  After Dad passed away earlier in the year, mum had mentioned that she'd always wanted to see
Vienna.  With inexpensive routes available from both Edinburgh and London to Budapest and back from Vienna, it made sense to 
visit both, and take a typically European train trip between the two. 

That said, the first day was a lot of waiting.  We don't normally fly out of Heathrow if we can at all avoid it, because it's frankly awful. 
Awful to get to, and unless you're in T5, awful to spend time in. 

Case in point, awful to get to: Â£80 cab or train, tube, tube, tube, walk for 20 minutes once you're 'there' at the airport 

So here we are waiting at Hatton Cross, because the other option is to sit on the train for an extra ten minutes at T4 before it 
goes to 1/2/3.

Not pictured: The absolute travesty that is Heathrow T3 security.  It wasn't terrifically busy, but it's just built with several bottlenecks, a far 
cry from the efficiency of London City, or even Gatwick.  It made Edinburgh airport look efficient, and that's saying something. 

Here we are waiting at the gate at Heathrow.   At least, since it was gate 1, we were as far away from everyone else as you can possibly be 
in T3, which meant that it was very quiet, with just our plane of people waiting to go, and no one else milling about or passing through.

Budapest being quite the international destination these days, you can get flights from all over.  Although we were flying from London, 
mum was coming from Edinburgh.  At that, we'd managed to get flights that landed about 45 minutes apart, so we made an impromptu sign and waited.  
(Note J's face, the result of a playground coming-together of his face and a toy fire-engine, apparently.  Looks worse than it is, and it's nearly 
gone by day 4 of the holiday, just a tiny bit of pinkness left)

Her flight was 25 minutes early! This. Never. Happens. Bags picked up and away we went, ordering a cab from Bolt that arrived quickly and drove 
sedately and sensible. We stayed at a very nice apartment on Brody Sandor utca, just near the national museum. 
Oddly, no fewer than three different sets of friends have now stayed, in unrelated circumstances in the same place at the  Museum krt end of the street. 

A quick bite to eat at a burger place over on  Kecskemeti ut, and then crashed out for the night.

Breakfast at Good Morning.



Wandering up, we realised that we'd never seen Sent Istvans, even though we've been here multiple times.   Tme to sort that. 

One of the grandest churches or cathedrals that we've ever been in - as decorated as the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, but with much 
higher ceilings and a huge sense of scale.  The dome was quite remarkable.

There must be a couple of tonnes of gold in here on the various surfaces.  Veering over into gaudy a lot of the time.

There's the option to pay 1000 HUF per adult to take the lift up into the dome of the Cathedral itself.  When the cathedral was originally planned, 
the dome was supposed to be around 80m high.  By the time they manged to build it and get up to that height, the rapidly industrialising 
Pest side of the river already had a number of buildings that were reaching that height, including the new Parliament building, so the architect decided to add a secondary dome to increase the height to 
96m.  Local building regulations in Budapest still prohibit the building of structures taller than the 96m threshold in the centre of the city.

The view from outside the secondary dome is incredible.  Here we're looking out over (Westward) the main entrance down  Zrinyi u. with its 
numerous resturants and cafes.

After lunch, we decided to take in Varosliget park (Var-osh-eeg-let) at the top end of Andrassy avenue, so it was into the depths of the tube for us all.  
![](/assets/img/budapest-2019/metro-line-stairs.jpg)

Varosliget was one of the first public parks in the world, and was combined with the second electrified underground railway to make it accessible to the public.  The M1 line runs underneath Andrassy avenue 
from Vorosmarty by the river to Mexikoi ut in the north east (and conveniently, where you'd get off to go to the Hungaroring.)   The line originally just ran up to the park and the baths, but has been extended up to Mexikoi in more recent years. 

It's an incredibly beautiful and peaceful park at all times of the year, but particularly in the autumn with the falling and fallen leaves and every colour 
imaginable in the trees.  This being late october, the lake by Vaajdahunyad castle was already being drained for winter.  Made for a great place to play aeroplanes, though.

Vajdahunyad castle itself looks like some sort of Disney set as you walk around and through the grounds.  At the bottom of this you can see the horse boxes and tents - not sure if they were for an upcoming event in the drained lake
or for something that we'd already missed.  Either way, there was space for hundreds of horses.

Cake!

Coming back out of the park towards the top of Andrassy, you come by Hosok Ter, or Heroes Square, which has statues of the Seven Chieftans of the Magyars, and some other important historical 
Hungarian leaders.

Mum was very pleased to be getting a seat on the tram (I actually think this is the second day, by Gellert hill, but let's gloss over that.)

In the evening we went to Byblos [about five minutes walk from the Apartment on Brody Sandor ](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Byblos+-+Fine+Lebanese+%26+Levantine+Cuisine/@47.4926367,19.0598911,16.08z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x4741ddbc7772a55d:0x87bd527f58be730b!8m2!3d47.494401!4d19.0588283).  
The restaurant came highly recommended (via trip advisor, I think), and serves Lebanese food, it was absolutely splendid, and far too much 
food for the four of us.

This is the relief of one of the buildings on a street perpendicular to Brody Sandor - remarkably, this beautiful building is a 
High School - the Saint Steven Commercial Vocational High School.
