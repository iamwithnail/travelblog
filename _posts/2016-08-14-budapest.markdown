# Arrival, accommodation and airplanes.
So after a quick dash through Vienna airport (45 minutes on the ground!) we hopped on this puddle jumper:

Surprisingly, our luggage made it at the same time as us. We bussed and Metro'd into town on the m3 line.

#### Homeless

Then the fun began. We'd paid for a three bed apartment, mostly because it was a half price, rather than through need. When we messaged to say we were there, they directed us to another address, where they had a free apartment. Except it wasn't an apartment. It was a hostel, full of Sziget-attending-bros wandering about in their pants, brushing their excessive teeth, and saying bro an awful lot.

The place offered a four bed bunkroom. Not cool, doubly not cool with a four year old.  Major party hostel. Boss man 'afford' to cancel our booking. Not on. Homeless with a four year old?

Flipped out, saw another room, made phonecalls to the boss and booking.com and offered an 'upgrade'... To a ten bunk room. Still no kitchen and still.one room. Maria used her annoyed voice. An apartment was offered. A 2k walk later with the saddest boy in the world by this point, and we get the apartment we expected - 2 bedrooms and a living room.  Parquet floors as is common here (and super nice to walk about on) and comfy beds. The apartment wasn't ready and it took some sorting but we got there, and a great apartment, finally! The boss offered it to booking.com as an upgrade, except it was exactly what we'd booked. Scam artist: don't use central apartments Budapest! To compound this, an agent turned up on the second day demanding to be let in, as she had people to view it for a long term let. She got short shrift. Idiots. Anyway - nice place.

On to more fun stuff. 
We met up with Grey, who's literally cycling around the world. This is his bike, not him.

Bike...and had dinner in Ket Szercsen at the end of the street - highly recommended.

Next day: 
After a pretty leisurely breakfast looking at Saint Istvan basilica, we headed off into Buda, on a local 291 bus - actually an underrated way of sightseeing cities. We were heading to the libeg√≥ chairlift and it was pretty fun, even though I don't like heights. But sometimes you have to suck it up -i was glad I did, the views were amazing, particularly on the way down.

You rise 220m over a mile, topping out at about 450m with great views (if you can find the right spot) over the city.
