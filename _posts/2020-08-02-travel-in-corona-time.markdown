## Planning and Travelling in a time of Corona 

All of the posts that follow in the 2020 trip are noted on the basis that:  
- we're extremely fortunate (and grateful) to be in a position where we can travel at all
- we considered whether or not to travel anywhere 
- we took account of the risks to us, and to others 

It's a particularly serious business, travelling when there's a pandemic on.  As well as exposing yourself to the risks of a new area, 
with potentially different levels of infection ongoing, there's always the risk that it's going to be you being the superspreader.  That family that was the 
vector for a new outbreak of Coronavirus across Europe.  

With the UK seemingly spiralling back towards another lockdown, we took the view that we would be a notch more careful than the letter of the local regulations - masks even if not required, lots of hand sanitiser, no indoor settings unless we can avoid it (and we got some funny looks for this - worth it, though).  

The first week we'd spend largely outdoors with a family from J's school 
that we're basically bubbled with anyway.  After that we'd be doing the same as at home - working from home, 
home schooling a bit, and going to local parks outdoors, but in a much more rural location than London, so lower risk overall. 

We also discussed and made contingency plans of what we would do if one of us did actually get sick. As it is (writing on 10th August), it looks like we're going 
into quarantine when we get back to the UK anyway, so will be doubly likely to be minimising the exposure to others.  

When we planned the trip (second and third weeks of July), France looked quite stable and 
flat on infection rates, and almost immediately after we booked Eurotunnel, it started trending upwards again.  I don't know, maybe we cursed it.  Sorry. 

Here's our overall route - to Switzerland in two reasonably laid back days, staying in private accomodation rather than hotels 
and back via Bois-Le-Rois, again staying away on our own so we can work remotely for the rest of the month.
