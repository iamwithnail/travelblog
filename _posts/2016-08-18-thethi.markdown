## First day

After our eventful journey, we finally arrived in Theth around 7:15, a three hour journey to cover xx km.  
We unpacked quickly and watched the last of the evening light fade over the mountains.

Although there are dozens of photos  here, none of them come close to doing it justice as to how dramatic they are.

The restaurant next door was full/closed or some combination of both, so we went one door further down, and my boots got 
christened in the mud outside.  Zorgji's was great, a real traditional Albanian place with nice food that was 
all local.  I had to assume the lamb we were eating was a relative of some of the ones we'd seen on the way in blocking the roads. 
The kitchen is through that door, and there was a table of old Albanian men (all locals, I'd hazard) to our right who did 
a good line in stopping and staring as we came in - all of the other tourists were eating outside, but it was
sufficiently cold that we didn't want to, especially having just come off the beach.

A quick glass of beer on the balcony and some peering at the stars, and we were done for the day - an early night, 
since breakfast was between 7 and 8:30.  Karola, the lovely manager, did offer to make an exception for us, I think 
because she'd taken a shine to J. :)


The next day we'd planned to walk to the Blue Eye of Theth, which is about a three hour walk each way (9.5km), and a bit of 
sightseeing en route and while you're there.  With one thing and another, we weren't ready to go until about 11, 
so opted for the shorter route, to Grunas Waterfalls, and taking in the lock-in tower on the way.  

Just outside the immediate village.

I realised that I singularly managed to forget any photos of the outside, so instead have a picture of the badly 
translated sign in front of it.  A small girl of about 10 came and took our money and permitted us inside 

![](/assets/img/albania/thethi-defense-tower.jpg)

Lots of small windows that it's hard to fire things into...

J liked that there were treasure chests, albeit tiny.  Although the rest of the artefacts in the museum/tower were 
fairly obvious in their purpose, this one seemed to be bizarrely ceremonial and wasn't really attached to anything.

A thing that struck us both was the similarity between the Albanian Ethnography Museum in Pristine and here. The museum had traditional 
Albanian house layout and furnishing and I suppose I was mildly surprised to see the same here in 
what is effectively a late middle-ages version of a panic room.

On the way to the lock-in tower, we saw the pipe 'bridge', which I've seen in other people's photos.  What I 
wasn't really prepared for though was the frankly terrifying Ladder to Nope.  For scale, that ladder's probably 4 metres
tall, and is made out of ancient wood and hope.

After skirting round the red bridge, we took the steep fork up the hill, and headed for the waterfalls, stopping
to get a drink a stone house half on a sweet little plateau/glade that emerged out of the trees.  It had a pretty
excellent swing chair for reading in.

There were also loads of small (and a couple of not so small) river crossings to do, and we spent a good fifteen minutes
following a babbling stream upstream to find the waterfalls when we lost the markings for a little bit - helped 
along the way by the frequent sets of other tourists that were coming the other way.  Were we going the wrong 
way on a one-way loop?  No one seemed to mind too much.  Here's a rock pool by one of the small crossings, with the 
red bridge (more on that later), just opposite.

We made it up to the waterfalls, for some just astonishing views.  The waterfalls themselves were far more spectacular 
than these photos really give them credit for.

One of the secondary waterfalls further down.

There were lots of good spots for clambering around.

Happy Campbells.

And lots of beautiful rock pools.

After much clambering down from the waterfall on the far side, we stopped for a rest after a river crossing, 
but only one of the tributaries of the Thethit, not the main river itself.  We found this beautiful little glade 
that was perfect to stop and have a drink and a short read in the dappled sunlight.

Brilliantly, this was the view from where we sat - the waterfalls themselves are off to the left, but I like 
this one because the rock outcropping at the top centre of the picture looks like a face, I think.  Once you've 
seen it, you'll never be able to unsee it.

The red bridge was one of the landmarks given to us by the lodge for navigation.  It seemed to mostly be in use
for the shoulder seasons, when the rivers would be much higher,

By the time we got back the sun was starting to set.  The mountains around the valley are so high that although it 
isn't actually sunset, the light is behind the mountains, so the light starts to go much earlier than lower down.

Stopped for a quick drink at Zorgji's on the way back, and was delighted to find this face-shaped water fountain. 
All of the water just comes from the river, since it's so clean.

We had a traditional Albanian dinner at the lodge, which was an absolute bargain at 7 Euros each - 
carrot & potato soup, fresh warm bread (careful, it's hot, it's just out the oven!), lamb, potatoes, stuffed peppers,
 and a yoghurt type dressing / side that was along the same lines as Tzatziki.

Just your average sunset up here.

Some mild entertainment as we got home; I opened the door to go into the apartment and a local brown rat ran past and into a hole 
in the floor.  Eek!  It's the countryside, and rodents are always a possibility, but the lodge staff were really great about it. I explained 
to the kitchen staff, who said Karola, the manager would sort it out when she came back.  I asked to borrow a saucepan and mimed
bashing it with them, much to their amusement.  

After Karola came back, she summoned the handyman for the property, who appeared with a large pair of blacksmith's
tongs - not entirely sure what he was intending on doing with those unless he was some sort of rat-whispering ninja. However, he
looked into where the rat had gone (it was cutting about between the bathroom panel and the hole that it'd originally disappered into), 
and sealed them up with bathroom sealant, which had the triple effects of : 
* not letting the rat back into the room
* making our room smell like salt and vinegar crisps 
* presumably deterring the rat with the god-awful smell 

Anyway, our little visitor didn't make a reappearance, so all good in the end.  Just bad luck that I happened to be going in at the 
same time as a rodent happened to be in the area! 


### Second day

The next day Maria was feeling poorly (something that would come back to haunt the rest of us over the next few days), 
so J and I went for a walk by ourselves, in the opposite direction (North-west, rather than South-East)

It took us up past the other lodges and away from 'town', up towards the mountain path to Peja (the one in Albania, rather than 
the one in Kosovo where we stayed in 2016), which is about 8km away over a middling difficulty hike.  We took a short walk 
along a bit of the route, and admired what looked like a forest-management burn of some of the trees.

Coming back into town was a treat as well.

Only one more day of these views.
